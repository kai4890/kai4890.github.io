                        Prototipe is a Multiplayer First Person Shooter set in a Sci-Fi Era, I worked on the game from late 2018 around 2 months after I finished the Ball Roller project to the end of 2020. To develop the game I enlisted the assistance from one of my classmates, Rhys Blaxland. Whereas I focused on all aspects of the game, Rhys lent a bit of assistance when it came to the coding aspect of the game. It was my first large scale game I worked on, despite my lack of experience I deliberately aimed high in order to challenge myself and learn new skills in the process.

                        This video was created for a Year 10 IST Multimedia assignment which took place during Term 1. It was first venture into the world of Video Editing and Special Effects. Itâ€™s loosely based off the world I first established in my game Prototipe. In the video, the main character General Jason Webb crash lands his fighter on Oberst and requests assistance from the branch of the Galactic Military called the GSF, yet his transmission is intercepted by a warring faction called The Ver-Sion, and they dispatch out one of their best commanders Jack and a squad of soldiers to eliminate Jason.

                        My first venture in the world of Game Development: Ball Roller X, this project was what sparked my love for programming and set me down my current path. Based off a Unity tutorial I modified it to have 10 levels with increasing difficulty and a menu and level select system. It had 2 enemy types and collectibles the player had to collect in order to progress to the next level. Should the player fall off the edge or touch the enemies the player would automatically respawn. Despite the game being very barebones, with no audio or title screen, it's a project that I learnt a lot from and as a result grew as a programmer.
